# **SQL Reflection**

***Reflecting on my previous work with SQL for products, vendors, and customers within the course, I realise it's crucial to consider the ethical implications and address inequities that might arise in data handling and business practices. One significant area to focus on is ensuring data privacy and security for customer information. When handling customer data, especially in JOIN operations and cross-referencing tables, it is essential to implement robust encryption and anonymization techniques to protect personal information (highly dangerous in the wrong hands). SQL operations should be designed to minimize the risk of exposing sensitive data, and access to such data should be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.***

***Furthermore, addressing inequities in vendor and product data is equally important. For instance, ensuring fair representation of small and minority-owned vendors in the product inventory can be a step toward promoting equity. This can be achieved by incorporating mechanisms in the SQL queries and database design that highlight and give visibility to these vendors.***


***Additionally, analyzing sales data to identify and mitigate any biases in product availability or pricing that might disadvantage certain customer groups is vital. By embedding these ethical considerations into SQL queries and database management practices, we can contribute to a fairer and more responsible data-driven business environment. ***
